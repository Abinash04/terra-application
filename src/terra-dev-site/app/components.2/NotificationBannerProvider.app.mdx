# NotificationBannerProvider 
The NotificationBannerProvider serves as a registration gateway for [Notification Banners](/application/terra-application/application/application/notification-banner)
rendered within it. Any NotificationBanner rendered within the context of a NotificationBannerProvider will register itself with the NotificationBannerProvider. When registered, the NotificationBannerProvider will ensure the notification banners are prioritized and displayed in a list above all other content.

Banners are prioritized by type and in the following order:
- Alert
- Error
- Warning
- Unsatisfied
- Unverified
- Advisory

## Usage

```jsx
import { useNotificationBanners } from 'terra-application/lib/notification-banner';
```
